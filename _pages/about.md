I am a second year PhD student in Operations Research and Financial Engineering department at Princeton University.

My research interests lie primarily in optimization and machine learning, in particular mixed integer optimization, algorithm design and verification, bilevel optimization, and real-time optimization. 

Before Princeton, I completed my BASc in the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto, majoring in Machine Intelligence
